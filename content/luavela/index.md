Recently, IPONWEB open sourced its fork of LuaJIT called
[LuaVela](https://github.com/iponweb/luavela). The original announcement post
can be found [here](http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2019-08/msg00041.html)
where a lot of details about it can be found. For those who don't know - my real
name is Ilya Daylidyonok, and I'm mentioned in the announcement!

I've worked on LuaVela for the last 7 months and now I want to tell about my
experience.

## Intro

Lua has been dear for me for a long time. It's an amazing language. It's easy to
integrate it with C++, it's fast, and it's a joy to write code with it.  I've
used it in my games and other projects for the last 6 years, so it's my "mother
tongue" as much as C++ at this point.

Another thing that makes Lua dear to me is that [the
articles](https://eliasdaler.wordpress.com/tag/tutorial/) I've written about it
were received very well and this has given me a lot of motivation to write more.
If you Google "Lua C++", you'll see my blog somewhere on the first page (maybe
it'll even be the first result!). That's how popular the articles have gotten.

I've been fascinated by compilers for a long time, and I've always wanted to do
some work in that field. And this became possible when I've started working at
IPONWEB.

## LuaJIT's 2GB problem

You don't usually stumble upon companies working on their own compilers (or even
forks of them). One of the reasons IPONWEB choose to do so, is that it hit
(in)famous limitation of LuaJIT: its 2GB RAM limit.

LuaJIT was originally written with 32 bit architecture/pointers in mind. When
you ran it on 64 bit platforms, you had a limitation: you could only adress 1GB
of RAM (because of mmap limitations), so this was LuaJIT's memory limit. In
newer Linux kernels the limit was raised to 2GB, but it still wasn't enough for
some projects IPONWEB did. This became a serious problem by 2015. LuaJIT 2.1
wasn't stable enough for production use at this point, and other possible
solutions to the problem the problem just weren't good enough. People at IPONWEB
decided to fork LuaJIT.

## Forking LuaJIT

Lua community is one of the most segmented communities I've ever seen. LuaJIT
can be partially blamed for that. A lot of people stayed somewhere between Lua
5.1 and Lua 5.2 because they used LuaJIT. LuaJIT got huge performance gains
for them, so migrating to Lua 5.2 and Lua 5.3 was not possible.

LuaJIT also has a lot forks. People add optimizations which work well for them,
but don't work that well in general case. People fix bugs, which can't be easily
ported to upstream, because of its cross-platform support and very high
standards to which patches must conform (which are justified!).

When LuaVela (called uJIT internally until the release) became yet another fork,
people who started it wanted for it to conform to the standard (vanilla) Lua as
much as possible. A lot of tests were added to ensure standard conformance.
LuaVela is a "drop-in" replacement for Lua 5.1 and LuaJIT. It's likely that if
you replace your Lua/LuaJIT headers in your code, you'll just get LuaVela to
work with your code and might see performance benifits immediately.

Another thing that was done early on was dropping cross-platform support. We
used LuaVela for projects which ran on x86-64 Linux only and it was difficult
for our small team to try to support all the other platforms.

## What I've found interesting about LuaJIT

During my first days at IPONWEB, I've started digging into LuaVela's and
LuaJIT's codebase. There is an in-depth
[e-mail](http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2009-11/msg00089.html) by Mike Pall
(the author of LuaJIT) which explains some of the stuff about how LuaJIT works
and why it is so fast and good at generating assembly. I'll go over a few things
I've found fascinating about LuaJIT's implementation.

First of all, LuaJIT's interpreter is written in assembly (in
[DynASM](https://luajit.org/dynasm.html), to be precise) and [it can perform
faster](http://luajit.org/performance_x86.html) than vanilla Lua 5.1 in 2-4
times. One of the reasons for that are some incredible performance optimizations
that were done in handcrafted assembly to reduce the number of RAM lookups and
stores. A lot of the computations are done using CPU registers - most of the
time you have function's parameters and local variables stored in CPU registers
and so a lot of computations are done without accessing the RAM. There are also
some optimizations (like expression folding) which are done at script's initial
convertion to bytecode (when your module is loaded by Lua).

Another cool thing is that LuaJIT and C share the same stack and LuaJIT honors
C ABI to do function calls. This is one of the reason why Lua/C calls are so
cheap there - they're almost identical to C function calls.

LuaJIT's interpreter is written in DynASM, a higher level assembly, which allows
you to write "macros", have constants and other things to make your assembly
writing process faster, safer and easier to read. You can find LuaVela's
improved interpreter
[here](https://github.com/iponweb/luavela/blob/master/src/vm_x86.dasc). A lot
was done to refactor and document [original LuaJIT's
interpreter](https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT/blob/v2.1/src/vm_x86.dasc), so I
think that it's a useful learning resource even if you don't plan to use LuaVela
in your project.

When it comes to JIT/compilation part, LuaJIT shines again - it uses a huge
number of optimizations to make generated assembly fast. It generates linear
"traces" - assembly without branches and jumps. The only jumps that are
there are *exit conditions*: you compile a trace using some invariants and
assumptions, e.g. that some variable should stay constant or have a certain
type. When this assumption gets broken, you *exit* the trace, and either find
another trace or just continue execution in the interpreter.

All function calls in a trace are inlined - this one also gives a considerable
performance boost. There is also a huge number of "fold" optimizations which
transform things like `2 + 2 + x + x` into `4 + 2*x` (even function calls,
especially to math functions can be folded sometimes!).

There are also built-ins like `string.find` or `math.abs` which are either
written in C/asm, or are written as C functions which tell LuaJIT which IRs to
emit, so you get very efficient assembly as the result of a final trace
generation.

For example, calling `math.abs` essentially turns into few instructions in a
trace. There's no table lookup into `math` table, there's even no call to C's
`abs` function!

LuaJIT's IR is linear: it's laid out contiguously in memory. It's one of the
reasons why optimizations and code generation happen quickly and don't have
noticeable performance overhead in most cases.

## LuaVela's new features

What makes LuaVela different from other LuaJIT forks? I'll quote the [original
announcement post](http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2019-08/msg00041.html):

* Full support for 64-bit memory without any tricks or hacks in the
interpreter and JIT compiler;
* "Sealing": An ability to hide some data from the garbage collector.
In IPONWEB, we use this generation-like (or, better, Eden-like) trick
to mark data with the same lifetime as the application instance itself
reducing overall pressure on GC;
* Immutability: Data structures may be (recursively) marked immutable
in run-time. This implemented via an extension API, the syntax of the
language is unaffected;
* Coroutine timeouts: There are C-level extension APIs that allow to
control the life time of coroutines â€“ once a coroutine runs for too
long, it is terminated by the virtual machine;
* Some new optimizations in the JIT compiler (but some of them are not
brand new if one compares with LuaJIT 2.1);
* New C- and Lua-level extension APIs;
* Platform-level sampling profiler;
* Memory usage profiler;
* Platform-level code coverage.
* CMake is used as a build system for the project;
* 6 test suites are bundled with the project: Lua 5.1 test suite,
LuaJIT test suite, CERN MAD test suite (partially), lua-Harness test
suite and two suites written inside IPONWEB (for testing at Lua- and
C-level, respectively);
* Documentation bundle is included into the release, too. All the docs
are in the RST format and `make docs` will build you the HTML version
if you have Sphinx installed.

## My contributions to LuaVela

Here's some of the stuff I did in the 7 months that I've worked on LuaVela:

* Added `ujit.table.size` built-in for counting non-nil elements in a Lua table (both array and hash parts)
* Created `ujit.math` module which is used to test if number is finite, +-ifn or NaN (in [IEEE-754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-1985) terms)
* Implemented `ujit.string.trim` and `ujit.string.split` built-ins - the first one removes whitespace from both ends of the string, and another allows you to iterate over strings like this:

```lua
local t = {}
for token in ujit.string.split("a,b,c", ",") do
    table.insert(t)
end
-- t == { "a", "b", "c" }
```

* Improved byte code dumping. LuaJIT and LuaVela have "-b" flag used for
  printing byte code of a Lua chunk. I've figured out that you can actually do
  something close to gdb's `disas /s` with it (when source code lines are printed next to corresponding assembly). The resulting flag "-B" does this:

{{< figure src="bytecode.png" >}}

* Improved testing system and helped make it more consistent across different testing suites.
* Migrated repo from hg to Git. I used
  [hg-fast-export](https://github.com/frej/fast-export) for this, but it wasn't
  simple as that. Initially uJIT started inside another repo, and so the history
  was full of empty commits when the transfer to another repository happened.
  Also "closing branch" commits from hg were adding a lot of noise. I've written a Python script which iterated over the entire history and rewrote it while excluding empty commits and saving authorship, time of commit and feature branches from HG repo.
* Made tons of CMake improvements - the most significant was adding support for
  out of source build and testing. Another cool thing was migrating to
  `ExternalProject` for third party libraries, which made the build process a
  lot cleaner. I also introduced some modern CMake practices in our build scripts, which made everyone's lives a bit easier.
* Fixed non-conformant code to enable `-std=c11` and `-pedantic`. LuaJIT used
  something close to GNU 99 standard for everything, but didn't really specify
  the standard. It turned out that GCC is using `-std=gnu11` by default since
  GCC 5, so we've decided to fix all non-conforming code. Some interesting changes:
    - `-std=gnu11` allows you to forward declare enums, ISO C doesn't
    - You need to explicitly cast pointers to `void*` before printing them with
      `printf`, e.g.:

```c
struct some_type* ptr = &some_obj;
printf("pointer: %p", (void*)ptr);
//                    ^^^^^^^
```

- Casting a function pointer to `void*` is not allowed by C standard, but this is okay to do on Linux, and LuaJIT uses it often for storing callbacks, and dlsym returns void*, so I had to disable -pedantic for lines that do so.
- `##__VA_ARGS__` is not in ISO C, which is painful, because if you have a macro with variadic arguments, you can't pass "nothing" in such macros
- enum values must be initialized with integer constant expressions, but
  LuaJIT used `uint32_t` for `x86Op` `enum`
- expressions like these are permitted in GNU C, but not in ISO C:

```c
void f() {
    return g();
}
```

* Implemented a process of mirroring patches from internal repo to a public one.
  We have some internal docs and other secret stuff in the private repo, so I've
  made a script which excludes changes to these files
* I've also done a lot of clean up for the code base in general to make
  sure that when we open source the project, it looks as good as possible.


## Future

At the moment, the development of LuaVela is finished. We'll fix critical bugs,
but we felt that LuaVela is close to being feature complete and fast enough for
most of our use cases, so we've moved on to other projects.  LuaVela was open
sourced as a "thank you" for Lua and LuaJIT community and developers. I hope
that some of the unique things LuaVela has will be later ported to other active
forks and make the software which uses it even faster and better.

I've enjoyed working on LuaVela: I've learned a lot about Lua and JIT
compilation. I've also got some real life C programming experience. It was
great.

Thanks for reading!
